== Installation ==

1. Upload the `easyrotator` folder and all of its contents into your plugins directory (`/wp-content/plugins/` by default)
1. Open the WordPress admin panel and go to the 'Plugins' page
1. Activate the new 'EasyRotator for WordPress' item in the list of plugins
1. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete setup
1. Add rotators to your posts and pages via the new Insert EasyRotator button in the post editor.  Add rotators to your theme via the EasyRotator Rotator widget in the Widgets panel.

**To add rotators directly to template files (e.g. in the site header):**

You can use the template function included with the plugin.  To do this, first create your rotator and insert it into a temporary page; this will allow you to obtain the special rotator ID code.  When you insert the rotator in your page, a shortcode will be inserted:

`[easyrotator]erc_00_xxxxxxx[/easyrotator]`

The `erc_00_xxxxxxx` value is the special rotator ID code.  To add this rotator to your template, add the following function call in your template file:

`<?php
easyrotator_display_rotator('erc_00_xxxxxxx');
?>`

Replace `erc_00_xxxxxxx`  with the real code you obtained by creating the rotator.
